# Volcano Adopter Group

The structure and content of this Volcano Adopter Group draw significant inspiration from the [Karmada Adopter Group](https://github.com/karmada-io/community/blob/main/adopter-group/README.md).
Wording has been adapted or adopted from their document to ensure clarity and consistency for similar concepts.
We respect and appreciate the contribution of the Karmada community.

## Introduction

The Volcano Adopter Group is a community initiative to foster a welcoming and dynamic environment for individuals and organizations utilizing the Volcano project.
This group facilitates the sharing of knowledge, best practices, and user experiences. It also provides a platform for users to connect, collaborate on projects, and contribute to the enhancement of Volcano.
