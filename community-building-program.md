The goals and benefits of the former program will continue under the framework of the Adopter Group, which aims to recognize and support organizations and individuals actively using Volcano.

**For more details about the Volcano Adopter Group, including how to join, please refer to the [Volcano Adopter Group](adopter-group/README.md).**

We encourage your continued participation in the Volcano community through the Adopter Group!
